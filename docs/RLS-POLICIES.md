# Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies Documentation

## Overview

Comprehensive RLS policies have been implemented for all 30 tables in the WealthRM App database. These policies implement role-based access control to ensure data security and proper data isolation between users.

## Migration Status

‚úÖ **Migration Applied:** `create_rls_policies_for_all_tables`

All tables now have RLS enabled with appropriate policies defined.

---

## Current Authentication Context

### Important Note
The application currently uses **Express session-based authentication** with **Supabase Service Role Key** in the backend. This means:

- ‚úÖ **RLS policies are defined and active** in the database
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Service role key bypasses RLS** (by design in Supabase)
- üîÑ **Policies will activate** when:
  - Frontend uses Supabase client directly (with anon key)
  - You migrate to Supabase Auth
  - You use authenticated Supabase requests (not service role)

### Helper Functions Created

The migration created these helper functions to support RLS:

1. **`get_current_user_id()`**
   - Returns the current user ID from JWT claims or app settings
   - Supports both Supabase Auth and custom session auth
   - Returns NULL for service role (allows bypass)

2. **`get_current_user_role()`**
   - Returns current user role: 'relationship_manager', 'supervisor', or 'admin'

3. **`is_admin()`**
   - Returns true if current user is admin

4. **`is_supervisor()`**
   - Returns true if current user is supervisor or admin

5. **`get_team_user_ids()`**
   - Returns array of user IDs that current supervisor/admin can access
   - Currently: supervisors see all relationship_managers
   - TODO: Implement actual supervisor-team relationships

## Access Control Model

### Relationship Managers (RMs)
**Can:**
- ‚úÖ SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE their own clients (`assigned_to = their_user_id`)
- ‚úÖ SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE their own prospects
- ‚úÖ SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE their own tasks and appointments
- ‚úÖ SELECT transactions for their clients
- ‚úÖ SELECT/INSERT communications they initiated or for their clients
- ‚úÖ SELECT their own performance metrics, targets, actuals
- ‚úÖ SELECT active talking points and announcements
- ‚úÖ SELECT products (read-only)
- ‚úÖ SELECT their own client drafts

**Cannot:**
- ‚ùå See other RMs' clients or data
- ‚ùå Modify products, talking points, announcements
- ‚ùå Delete clients or transactions
- ‚ùå Access supervisor/admin functions

### Supervisors
**Can:**
- ‚úÖ Everything RMs can do
- ‚úÖ SELECT all team members' clients (all relationship_managers)
- ‚úÖ SELECT all team members' prospects, tasks, appointments
- ‚úÖ SELECT team performance metrics and analytics
- ‚úÖ SELECT team communications

**Cannot:**
- ‚ùå Modify data (still need to go through RMs or be admin)
- ‚ùå Access other supervisors' data
- ‚ùå Modify products, talking points, announcements

### Admins
**Can:**
- ‚úÖ **Full access** to all tables
- ‚úÖ SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE all records
- ‚úÖ Modify products, talking points, announcements
- ‚úÖ Manage users table
- ‚úÖ Override any RLS restrictions

## Testing RLS Policies

### Current Behavior
Since you're using **service role key** in backend:
- ‚úÖ Backend operations bypass RLS (work as before)
- ‚úÖ Policies are defined and ready
- ‚úÖ Will activate when using authenticated requests

### Testing with Authenticated Requests

To test RLS policies, you can:

1. **Use Supabase client with anon key** (frontend):
   ```typescript
   // This would be restricted by RLS
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from('clients')
     .select('*');
   ```

2. **Set user context** (for testing):
   ```sql
   -- Set user context for testing
   SET app.current_user_id = 1;
   SET app.current_user_role = 'relationship_manager';
   
   -- Now test queries
   SELECT * FROM clients; -- Should only see assigned clients
   ```

3. **Check policy execution**:
   ```sql
   -- See which policies apply
   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM clients;
   ```

---

## Future Migration to Supabase Auth

When migrating to Supabase Auth:

1. **Replace helper functions:**
   - Change `get_current_user_id()` to use `auth.uid()`
   - Change `get_current_user_role()` to read from `auth.users` table

2. **Update policies:**
   - Policies will automatically work with `auth.uid()`
   - No policy changes needed (they're designed to be compatible)

3. **Add user metadata:**
   - Store user role in `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data.role`
   - Or create a mapping table: `auth_user_roles(user_id, role)`

---

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ What's Protected
- Direct database access (when not using service role)
- Frontend Supabase client calls (when using anon key)
- Future API integrations using anon key

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
- Service role key bypasses all RLS (by design)
- Backend API routes using service role are not restricted by RLS
- Need application-level security in backend code

### üîí Recommended Next Steps

1. **Backend Security:**
   - Verify `req.session.userId` matches data being accessed
   - Add checks in API routes: `client.assigned_to === req.session.userId`
   - This provides defense in depth

2. **Frontend Security:**
   - If using Supabase client directly, use anon key (RLS will apply)
   - Always verify user permissions in UI

3. **Audit Logging:**
   - Consider adding audit logs for sensitive operations
   - Track who accessed/modified what data

---

## Policy Maintenance

### Adding New Tables
When adding new tables, create RLS policies following this pattern:

```sql
ALTER TABLE new_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "rm_select_own_data"
ON new_table FOR SELECT
USING (
  user_id = get_current_user_id()
  OR is_admin()
  OR (is_supervisor() AND user_id = ANY(get_team_user_ids()))
);
```

### Modifying Policies
To modify existing policies:

```sql
-- Drop old policy
DROP POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name;

-- Create new policy
CREATE POLICY "new_policy_name"
ON table_name FOR SELECT
USING (new_condition);
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Policy violation" errors
- **Cause:** Using anon key without proper user context
- **Solution:** Ensure user is authenticated and context is set

### Issue: Policies not working
- **Cause:** Using service role key (bypasses RLS)
- **Solution:** Use anon key for frontend or authenticated requests

### Issue: Can't see any data
- **Cause:** Helper functions returning NULL
- **Solution:** Set user context: `SET app.current_user_id = <user_id>`

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **All 30 tables have RLS enabled**
‚úÖ **Policies implement role-based access control**
‚úÖ **Ready for Supabase Auth migration**
‚úÖ **Currently bypassed by service role (expected behavior)**

The RLS policies provide a security foundation that will activate when:
- Frontend uses Supabase client with anon key
- You migrate to Supabase Auth
- You want to restrict direct database access

For now, continue using service role key in backend with application-level security checks.
