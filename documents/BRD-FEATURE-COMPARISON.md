## RECOMMENDATION

The existing project serves as a **solid CRM foundation** but requires **significant expansion** to meet BRD requirements. The recommended approach:

1. **Keep existing functionality** (Client, Prospect, Communication, Task management)
2. **Build new Financial Planning module** on top of existing structure
3. **Extend database schema** with all BRD-required tables
4. **Implement workflow-driven UI** for planning journey
5. **Add regulatory compliance layer** for multi-jurisdiction support

The gap is substantial - approximately **70% of BRD functionality needs to be built**.
