## Parallel Development Strategy

### Daily Standup Structure
**Time:** 15 minutes daily
**Agenda:**
- What I did yesterday
- What I'm doing today
- Any blockers or dependencies

### Weekly Review Meeting
**Time:** 1 hour
**Agenda:**
- Demo completed features
- Review code (pull requests)
- Plan next week
- Resolve blockers

### Code Sharing Strategy
- **Git Branching:** Each member works on feature branches
- **Integration Points:** Weekly merges to develop branch
- **Conflict Resolution:** Daily standup to discuss overlaps

### Database Conflict Prevention
**Strategy:**
- Team Member 1 creates all migrations upfront
- Other members ask Team Member 1 for new fields
- Migrations reviewed before merge
- Use migration versioning

---

## Key Integration Points

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Database Schema → All Teams**
   - Team Member 1 completes Week 1-2 migrations first
   - All other members depend on this

2. **Risk Profiling APIs → Frontend Teams**
   - Team Member 2 depends on Team Member 1's APIs
   - Sync required Week 2

3. **Goal Calculators → Product Selection**
   - Team Member 3 needs calculator results for product allocation
   - Sync required Week 6

4. **Proposal APIs → PDF Generation**
   - Team Member 4 needs proposal data structure
   - Sync required Week 8

### Integration Testing
**Week 13-14 (Integration Sprint):**
- All team members participate
- End-to-end testing of complete workflow
- Bug fixes and polish
- Performance optimization
- User acceptance testing
