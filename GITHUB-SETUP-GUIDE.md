# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up Your Team Repository

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (Team Lead or Person 1)

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click "New repository"
3. Repository name: `WealthForce-RM-Dashboard`
4. Description: "Financial Planning & Need Analysis Platform for Wealth Advisors"
5. Make it **Public** (or Private if you have GitHub Team)
6. **Don't** initialize with README
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Project to GitHub

```bash
# Navigate to your local project
cd E:\WealthRMappPrimesoft\WealthRMappPrimesoft

# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Existing WealthForce CRM with baseline features"

# Add remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/WealthForce-RM-Dashboard.git

# Push to GitHub
git checkout -b main
git push -u origin main

# Create and switch to develop branch
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
```

### Step 3: Protect Main Branch (IMPORTANT)

1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Your Repository ‚Üí Settings
2. Click "Branches"
3. Add rule for `main`:
   - ‚úÖ Require pull request before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
   - ‚úÖ Dismiss stale pull request approvals
   - ‚úÖ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

### Step 4: Create Branch Protection for Develop

1. Add rule for `develop`:
   - ‚úÖ Require pull request before merging
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Allow force pushes (for rapid iteration)

### Step 5: Team Members Join

Each team member should:

```bash
# Fork the repository (on GitHub, click "Fork")
# OR clone directly if you have access
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/WealthForce-RM-Dashboard.git
cd WealthForce-RM-Dashboard

# Create develop branch
git checkout -b develop

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with database credentials

# Run database migrations
npm run db:push

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## Daily Workflow for All Team Members

### Every Morning
```bash
# Get latest code
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-assigned-feature

# Start working!
```

### During Development
```bash
# Commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "Add risk profiling API endpoint"

# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-assigned-feature
```

### End of Day
```bash
# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# OR merge if stable
git checkout develop
git merge feature/your-assigned-feature
git push origin develop
```

## GitHub Repository Structure

### Recommended Default Files (Already Created)

```
WealthForce-RM-Dashboard/

## Preventing Conflicts

### File Ownership Strategy

**Person 1 (Backend):**
- Owns: `shared/schema.ts` (coordinate changes!)
- Owns: `server/routes/risk-profiling.ts` (NEW)
- Owns: `server/services/calculator/` (NEW)

**Person 2 (Planning UI):**
- Owns: `client/src/components/financial-planning/RiskQuestionnaire/` (NEW)
- Owns: `client/src/pages/plan-creation.tsx` (NEW)
- No conflicts!

**Person 3 (Products UI):**
- Owns: `client/src/components/financial-planning/ProductSelection/` (NEW)
- Owns: `client/src/pages/product-selection.tsx` (NEW)
- No conflicts!

**Person 4 (PDF & Workflows):**
- Owns: `server/services/proposal-generation/` (NEW)
- Owns: `client/src/pages/approvals.tsx` (NEW)
- No conflicts!

**Everyone Touches:**
- `server/routes/index.ts` - Add routes here (coordinate!)
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Add routes here (coordinate!)
- `shared/schema.ts` - Person 1 coordinates, others ask permission

## Communication Plan

### Create GitHub Discussions
1. Go to Repository ‚Üí "Discussions" tab
2. Create categories:
   - ‚ùì Questions
   - üí° Ideas
   - üêõ Bug Reports
   - ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Use GitHub Issues
- Create issue for each feature
- Assign to team member
- Track progress
- Close when complete

### Use Pull Request Comments
- Review code there
- Suggest changes
- Ask questions
- Give feedback
